This repository holds the source code for an iPhone-like calculator. Developed using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, it emulates the key functionalities of a standard calculator including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also has a couple of extra functions such as the square root (√) and square (x²) operations.

The user interface of this calculator has been designed to match the sleek and simple design of the iPhone calculator, with the same layout and similar color scheme.

## Features

- Standard arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Square root operation
- Squaring operation
- Live display of input and operation results
- Error handling (e.g., division by zero)
- Responsive design

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone the repository

   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory

   ```bash
   cd odin-calculator
   ```

## Code Overview

The calculator logic is handled by a JavaScript file, where various event listeners are set up for button clicks and specific operations are performed. The script handles number input, operations, clear functions, and updating the display.

The CSS file contains all the styling for the calculator, giving it its iPhone-like appearance. The layout is created using a combination of Flexbox and CSS grid.

The HTML file sets up the structure of the calculator, including the display area and buttons.
